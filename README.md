# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard- Dashboard using public Superstore Sales data to analyze Overall Performance, regional performance, Category Profitability, Discount Impacts, and Overall Trend analysis. 

The objective of this project is to deliver a clear, actionable understanding of sales and profit performance across product categories and regions. By leveraging Power BI dashboards with interactive visualizations that reveal trends, highlight strengths and weaknesses, and support strategic recommendations, the analysis was designed to answer key business questions:
Which categories and regions drive the most value?
Where are profit margins lagging?
How do discounts and customer segments impact profitability?
What actions can maximize future growth and efficiency?

MY PROCESS: 
1. First, I found a public dataset that could be suitable for this project (Sample Superstore.csv). I chose this dataset because it included order date, sales, profit, quantity, discount amount, categories, and region so I could drill down and combine different datapoints to extract insights and answer common business questions. It also included 10,000+ rows initially to show my ability to use syndicated data efficiently.
2. After downloading the dataset, I had to clean and prepare it for visualizations. I added columns- profit margin, average order value, then formatted the columns to correlate with date, numeric, text, or percentage to enable calculations.
3. Once the data was imported into Power BI, I used Dax formulas to create new calculations and data measures to unlock new insights- I added Cumulative Sales %, total profit, total sales, and 3-month moving average.
4. Finally, I created four separate dashboards to showcase region performance, category performance, discount impact on profit, and YOY trends analysis to then tell a story of each based on the data. Each dashboard allows for filtering to drill down into specific region, category, year, or segment for more microscoped analysis.
